## 🚀 Project Overview

In a densely populated city like Chennai, overcrowding at public places is a common challenge. **Chennai Crowd Watch** addresses this by providing a dual-interface application:

1.  **Public Interface:** A user-friendly, map-based interface for the general public to view real-time crowd status, "best visit times," and historical trends.
2.  **Admin Interface:** A robust dashboard for authorities and administrators to manage camera feeds, analyze video data, and oversee the system's data inputs.

The system leverages **Computer Vision (YOLOv8)** to analyze video feeds in real-time, converting visual data into actionable crowd metrics.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌍 For Public Users
*   **Interactive Map:** A dynamic Leaflet-based map displaying key locations across Chennai with custom markers indicating crowd density.
*   **Real-Time Status:** Instant visual cues (Green/Yellow/Red) representing Low, Medium, and High crowd levels.
*   **Smart Recommendations:** AI-driven "Best Time to Visit" suggestions based on historical and current data.
*   **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts showing popular times and crowd trends using Recharts.
*   **Search Functionality:** easy-to-use search bar to find specific malls, parks, or beaches.

### 🛡️ For Administrators
*   **Dashboard:** specialized view for managing the system's core data.
*   **Live Camera Management:** Tools to add, remove, and monitor simulated or real CCTV feeds.
*   **Video Analysis:** Upload interface for processing recorded footage through the YOLOv8 engine to extract crowd data.
*   **System Health:** Monitoring of backend services and WebSocket connections.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern **Client-Server architecture**:

*   **Frontend:** A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, communicating with the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets.
*   **Backend:** A high-performance FastAPI server that handles API requests, manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates, and runs the YOLOv8 inference engine.
*   **AI Engine:** Ultralytics YOLOv8 model optimized for person detection, processing video frames to count individuals.

## ⚡ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or higher)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ADHITHIN/chennai-crowd-watch.git
cd chennai-crowd-watch
```

#### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder and set up the Python environment.

```bash
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the project root, and install dependencies.

```bash
# Ensure you are in the root directory (chennai-crowd-watch)
npm install
```

### Running the Application

**Option 1: Quick Start (Batch Script)**
If you are on Windows, you can use the provided batch file to start both services:
```bash
./run_backend.bat
```
*(Note: You made need to manually start the frontend server in a separate terminal if the batch file only targets the backend)*

**Option 2: Manual Start**

1.  **Start Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Ensure venv is active
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

2.  **Start Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # From project root
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:8080` (or similar), and the backend API will typically be at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📖 API Documentation

The backend exposes several endpoints. Once the server is running, you can visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive Swagger UI.

### Key Endpoints:
*   `GET /api/locations`: Retrieve all location data.
*   `POST /api/upload`: Upload video files for analysis.
*   `GET /api/camera`: List available camera feeds.
*   `WS /ws/camera/{camera_id}`: WebSocket endpoint for live camera streams.
*   `WS /ws/upload/{file_id}/progress`: WebSocket endpoint for video processing status.
